# Programming Assignment 1 - ARM Assembly

## **Overview**
This repository contains the solution for **Programming Assignment 1** of CDA3101. The goal of this assignment is to implement an **ARM Assembly** program that reads a string, calculates its length, determines if it is a palindrome, and prints the results.

## **Objective**
The ARM program performs the following tasks:
1. Prints **"Input a string:"**.
2. Reads the input string.
3. Calculates the **length** of the string.
4. Outputs the string length to the console.
5. Checks if the string is a **palindrome**.
6. Outputs whether the string is a palindrome **(T/F)**.

## **Files**
- `pa1.s` â†’ ARM Assembly source code for the program.
